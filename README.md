# RCAR-project

This is the repo for the Radio Controlled Arduino Racing project to be used as an activity at Rutgers IEEE presentation for the EOF summer institute. The idea is to have a simple moving Arduino robot to be controlled from a distance with a controller built from another arduino with tactile buttons to control direction and a potentiometer to change speed. The two arduinos should communicate using RF modules.



## About project

.ino files are created with their own folder so that means any classes that are not saved in the Arduino Library need to be saved within the Arduino Sketches folder.

RF Receiver and RF Transmitter prototypes are test programs to test communication between two Arduini.




## Components Used in this project

- [DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver Carrier](https://www.pololu.com/product/2135)

- [Refaxi RF Modules](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Transmitter-Receiver-Module-Arduino/dp/B00INTI8R2/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499012256&sr=8-1&keywords=refaxi+rf+module)

- [Button caps for remote controller](https://www.ebay.com/i/291735611601?chn=ps&dispItem=1)

## Prizes

Another aspect of this project is to have the participants get prizes for their achievments in the races, etc. So we need some prizes! While trying to limit the prizes to something the majority of attendants would be interested in so far I've thought of giving away excess T-shirts we have in the club and 3D printing some prizes.

#### For 3D printing:
