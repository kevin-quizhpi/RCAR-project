# RCAR-project

This is the repo for the Radio Controlled Arduino Racing project to be used as an activity at Rutgers IEEE presentation for the EOF summer institute. The idea is to have a simple moving Arduino robot to be controlled from a distance with a controller built from another arduino with tactile buttons to control direction and a potentiometer to change speed. The two arduinos should communicate using RF modules.
